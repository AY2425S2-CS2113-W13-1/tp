/**
 * Provides classes and utilities for managing game data persistence, retrieval, validation, and
 * parsing.
 *
 * <p>This package includes the following components:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link javatro.storage.Storage} - The primary interface for interacting with the storage
 *       system, following the Singleton pattern.
 *   <li>{@link javatro.storage.StorageManager} - Handles low-level storage operations, including
 *       saving, loading, and initializing game data.
 *   <li>{@link javatro.storage.DataParser} - Provides static utility methods for parsing and
 *       validating CSV data, ensuring data integrity before loading.
 *   <li>{@link javatro.storage.utils} - A sub-package containing utility classes such as:
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>{@link javatro.storage.utils.CardUtils} - Utility functions for card and joker
 *             parsing, validation, and formatting.
 *         <li>{@link javatro.storage.utils.HashUtil} - Provides a hashing mechanism using SHA-256
 *             for verifying data integrity.
 *       </ul>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This package is designed to work with the broader application through a clear interface
 * provided by {@code Storage}. Underlying operations are delegated to the {@code StorageManager},
 * ensuring separation of concerns and better modularity.
 *
 * <p>Assertions are employed throughout the package to ensure data consistency and validity.
