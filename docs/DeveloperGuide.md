        +propertyChange(...)  
    }  

    UI --> Screen : manages  
    Screen <|-- GameScreen : extends  
    GameScreen ..|> PropertyChangeListener : implements  
```  
*Simplified to highlight core relationships. The `UI` manages `Screen` instances, and `GameScreen` extends `Screen` while observing game state changes.*  



### 1. Overview  
The **UI module** manages screen transitions, user input, and formatted content rendering (e.g., bordered menus, card art). Designed using the **Singleton pattern**, it ensures a single point of control for display operations. This guide details the architecture, key components, and enhancements like dynamic screen rendering and transition logic.  

---

### 2. Architectural Design  

#### 2.1. High-Level Architecture  
The UI follows a **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**-inspired design:  
- **Model**: `JavatroCore` (game state).  
- **View**: `Screen` subclasses (e.g., `GameScreen`, `StartScreen`).  
- **Controller**: `UI` class (manages transitions, input parsing).  

##### Key Design Patterns:  
1. **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a single `UI` instance for centralized screen management.  
2. **Observer Pattern**: `GameScreen` listens to `JavatroCore` for state changes (e.g., score updates).  
3. **State Pattern**: Screens encapsulate state-specific behavior (e.g., `HelpScreen` vs. `GameScreen`).  

#### 2.2. Rationale for Key Decisions  
- **ANSI/Unicode Formatting**: Enables rich terminal UIs without external libraries.  
- **Abstract `Screen` Class**: Promotes code reuse (e.g., `displayOptions()` for command menus).  
- **Centralized `UI` Class**: Simplifies debugging and ensures consistent transitions.  

---

### 3. Component-Level Design  

#### 3.1. The `UI` Class  
**Responsibilities**:  
- **Screen Management**: Stores static references to all screens and handles transitions via `setCurrentScreen()`.  
- **Formatted Output**: Methods like `printBorderedContent()` and `centerText()` standardize layouts.  
- **Utility Functions**: `clearScreen()`, `getCardArtLines()` (renders ASCII card art).  

**Key Code Snippet**:  
```java  
public void setCurrentScreen(Screen screen) {  
    previousScreen = currentScreen;  
    currentScreen = screen;  
    currentScreen.displayScreen(); // Triggers screen-specific rendering  
    PARSER.getOptionInput(); // Handle user input  
}  
```  

#### 3.2. The `Screen` Class Hierarchy  
- **Abstract `Screen` Class**:  
  - Defines `displayScreen()` (abstract) and `displayOptions()` (common command menu).  
  - Manages `commandMap` (list of user-selectable options).  

- **Concrete Screens**:  
  - **`GameScreen`**: Displays real-time game stats, card art, and listens for state changes.  
  - **`HelpScreen`**: Shows static help content.  

**Example: `GameScreen` Property Listener**  
```java  
public void propertyChange(PropertyChangeEvent evt) {  
    switch (evt.getPropertyName()) {  
        case "currentScore":  
            roundScore = (Long) evt.getNewValue();  
            break;  
        // ... other cases  
    }  
    displayScreen(); // Re-render UI on state change  
}  
```  

---

### 5. Key Enhancements  

#### 5.1. Enhancement: Screen Transition Mechanism  
**Implementation**:  
- **Transition Messages**: ANSI-formatted logs (e.g., `Transitioning to: GameScreen`).  
- **Back Navigation**: `previousScreen` allows reverting to prior states (e.g., exiting `HelpScreen`).  

**Sequence Diagram**:  
```mermaid  
sequenceDiagram  
    actor User  
    participant UI  
    participant StartScreen  
    participant GameScreen  

    User->>UI: Enters "play" command  
    UI->>UI: setCurrentScreen(GameScreen)  
    UI->>StartScreen: Save as previousScreen  
    UI->>GameScreen: displayScreen()  
    GameScreen-->>UI: Rendered content  
```  

**Alternatives Considered**:  
- **Stack-Based History**: Rejected due to limited navigation depth requirements.  
- **Immediate Input Handling**: Chose deferred parsing via `Parser` to decouple input from rendering.  

#### 5.2. Enhancement: Dynamic Card Rendering  
- **Card Art Generation**: `CardRenderer` converts `Card` objects to ASCII art with ANSI colour formatting.  
- **Grid Layout**: Renders 8 cards in two rows, spaced with ANSI backgrounds.  

**Code Snippet**:  
```java  
public static List<String> getCardArtLines(List<Card> hand) {  
    List<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();  
    String[][] renderedCards = hand.stream().map(CardRenderer::renderCard).toArray(String[][]::new);  
    // Combine lines horizontally  
    return lines;  
}  
```

#### **5.3. Challenge: Emoji and Unicode Compatibility**  

##### **Initial Attempt**  
Emojis and Unicode symbols (e.g., üÉè, ‚ô•Ô∏è, ‚ô•) were initially incorporated into the UI to enhance visual appeal. For example:  
```java  
// Early prototype (discarded)  
private static String getSuitSymbol(Card.Suit suit) {  
    return switch (suit) {  
        case HEARTS -> "‚ô•Ô∏è";  
        case DIAMONDS -> "‚ô¶Ô∏è";  
        case CLUBS -> "‚ô£Ô∏è";  
        case SPADES -> "‚ô†Ô∏è";  
    };  
}  
```  

##### **Challenges**  
1. **Inconsistent Spacing**:  
   - Emojis/Unicode symbols vary in display width (e.g., `‚ô•Ô∏è` vs. `‚ô†Ô∏è`), causing misalignment in card art.  
   - Example: A heart symbol might be very slightly larger than a regular spacing, breaking grid layouts.  

2. **Terminal Compatibility**:  
   - Terminals like **Windows CMD / Windows Powershell** require `chcp 65001` to display Unicode, which is error-prone for users.  
   - Colored emojis are unsupported in many terminals, leading to monochrome or placeholder symbols (e.g., ` `).  

3. **ANSI Overlap**:  
   - Combining ANSI color codes with Unicode symbols introduced unpredictable formatting (e.g., background colors bleeding into adjacent text).  

##### **Final Approach**  
To ensure cross-terminal compatibility and consistent spacing, **letters** (`H`, `D`, `C`, `S`) replaced symbols:  
```java  
// Current implementation (CardRenderer.java)  
private static String getSuitSymbol(Card.Suit suit) {  
    return switch (suit) {  
        case HEARTS -> "H";  
        case DIAMONDS -> "D";  
        case CLUBS -> "C";  
        case SPADES -> "S";  
    };  
}  
```  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Fixed-width characters ensure alignment in card art.  
  - Works universally across terminals without configuration.  
  - ANSI colors apply cleanly to letters (e.g., `H` in red for hearts).

#### **UML Diagrams**  

##### **CardRenderer Class Diagram**  
```mermaid  
classDiagram  
    class CardRenderer {  
        +renderCard(Card): String[]  
        -getSuitSymbol(Suit): String  
        -getColour(Suit): String  
    }  
```  
*The `CardRenderer` class maps suits to letters (`H`, `D`, `C`, `S`) and colors using ANSI codes.*  

##### **Card Rendering Sequence Diagram**  
```mermaid  
sequenceDiagram  
    participant GameScreen  
    participant CardRenderer  
    participant Card  

    GameScreen->>CardRenderer: renderCard(card)  
    CardRenderer->>Card: getSuit()  
    CardRenderer->>CardRenderer: getSuitSymbol() ‚Üí "H"  
    CardRenderer->>CardRenderer: getColour() ‚Üí ANSI code  
    CardRenderer-->>GameScreen: [" H ", ...]  
    GameScreen->>UI: Display formatted card art  
```

#### **Key Takeaways**  
- **Prioritize Functionality Over Aesthetics**: Letters ensured reliability, while emojis introduced terminal-specific bugs.  
- **Test Across Environments**: The decision to avoid Unicode was driven by rigorous testing in CMD, PowerShell, and Unix terminals.  
- **Code Hygiene**: Unused symbols (e.g., `‚ô†` in `UI`) should be removed in future refactoring.  

This approach balances visual clarity with technical robustness, ensuring the UI works seamlessly for all users.

### 6. Future Considerations  

1. **GUI Framework Integration**: Migrate to JavaFX for animations and mouse support.  
2. **Theming System**: Allow users to customize colors via config files.  
3. **Accessibility Mode**: Add high-contrast themes and screen-reader support.  

---

### 7. Conclusion  
The UI module‚Äôs design prioritizes modularity, extensibility, and terminal compatibility. By combining design patterns like Singleton and Observer with ANSI formatting, it delivers a responsive and visually consistent experience. Future developers can extend it by adding new `Screen` subclasses or integrating modern GUI frameworks.


## Model Component

## **Ante and Blind class system :**

### **1. Introduction**

The **Ante and Blind System** in the game determines the minimum required score to beat for each round and regulates the increasing stakes as the game progresses. The **Ante** sets a base score to beat, while the **Blind** system introduces different blind levels (SMALL, LARGE, BOSS) each with a unique multiplier score effect to ensure competitive play. This section provides an in-depth look into its implementation, design choices, and a UML sequence diagram illustrating interactions.

### **2. Implementation**

#### **2.1 Class Overview**

The Ante class manages the ante value and blind progression. There are a total of 8 antes where each ante consists of 3 blinds (SMALL, LARGE, BOSS). The ante class maintains the current ante level the gameplay is at , determines the betting stakes, and updates the blind stage as the game progresses. 

#### **2.2 Attributes**

_int MAX_ANTE_COUNT_ = 8; ‚Äì Defines the maximum ante level progression.
_int anteCount;_ ‚Äì Stores the current ante level.
_Blind blind;_ ‚Äì Represents the current blind stage.
_int[] anteScore;_ ‚Äì An array storing predefined ante values for each level.

#### **2.3 Enum: Blind Levels**

The **Blind** enum represents different blind levels, each with a unique multiplier affecting the ante base score. Additionally, the **SMALL** and **LARGE** blinds are optional, giving the players a choice to accept or reject, meanwhile the **BOSS** blind is compulsory for the players to proceed to the next round.

**Code Snippet** :

```
public enum Blind {
SMALL_BLIND(1.0, "SMALL BLIND"),
LARGE_BLIND(1.5, "LARGE BLIND"),
BOSS_BLIND(2.0, "BOSS BLIND");

private final double multiplier;
private final String name;

Blind(double multiplier, String name) {
this.multiplier = multiplier;
this.name = name;
}
public double getMultiplier() {
return multiplier;
}
public String getName() {
return name;
}
}
```

#### **2.4 Methods**
**_public Ante()_:** 
Initializes ante at level 1 with Small Blind.

**public int getRoundScore()** :
Returns the ante score multiplied by the unique blind multiplier.

**_public void setAnteCount(int anteCount)_:**
Updates the ante count within valid bounds.

**_public void resetAnte()_:**
Resets ante to level 1 and Small Blind.

**_public void nextRound()_:**
Progresses to the next blind level or increases ante level when Boss Blind is reached.

**### 3. Design Considerations**

## ** 3.1 Alternatives Considered**

**1. Fixed Ante and Blind System**:
   Pros: Simple to implement and requires minimal logic.
   Cons: Lacks adaptability, making the game less engaging over time.

**2. Dynamic Blind Adjustment**:
   Pros: Adjusts difficulty dynamically, providing a more balanced progression.
   Cons: Requires additional tracking and logic to manage changes effectively.

   ## **3.2 Chosen Approach**
   To balance simplicity and dynamic progression, the enum-based structured Blind System. It cycles through Small Blind ‚Üí Large Blind ‚Üí Boss Blind, ensuring controlled progression while increasing the ante at the end of each cycle. This approach keeps gameplay engaging without overcomplicating the logic. Moreover the array-based ante progression simplifies lookup and ensures consistent bet increases. This structure prevents unfair jumps in bet sizes, ensuring a fairer experience for the players.

## **Class Diagram:** 

```mermaid 
classDiagram
classDiagram
    class Ante {
        -anteCount: int
        -blind: Blind
        -anteScore: int[]
        +Ante()
        +getRoundScore() int
        +getAnteScore() int
        +setAnteCount(anteCount: int)
        +resetAnte()
        +nextRound()
        +setBlind(blind: Blind)
        +getBlind() Blind
        +getAnteCount() int
    }

    class Blind {
        <<enumeration>>
        SMALL_BLIND
        LARGE_BLIND
        BOSS_BLIND
        +getMultiplier() double
        +getName() String
    }

    Ante --> Blind : uses
```  
The Ante class manages the ante count, blind levels, and scores in the game, utilizing the Blind enumeration for different blind levels.

```mermaid 
classDiagram
class Option {
<<interface>>
+getDescription(): String
+execute(): void
}

    class AcceptBlindOption {
        +getDescription(): String
        +execute(): void
    }

    class RejectBlindOption {
        +getDescription(): String
        +execute(): void
    }

    class JavatroCore {
        +getAnte(): Ante
        +currentRound: Round
    }

    class JavatroManager {
        +setScreen(screen: Screen): void
    }

    class UI {
        +getGameScreen(): Screen
        +getBlindScreen(): Screen
        +printBorderedContent(title: String, lines: List): void
        +BOLD: String
        +END: String
    }

    AcceptBlindOption --> JavatroManager : interacts with
    RejectBlindOption --> JavatroManager : interacts with
    AcceptBlindOption --> UI : interacts with
    RejectBlindOption --> UI : interacts with
```  
The Option interface is implemented by AcceptBlindOption and RejectBlindOption, which interact with JavatroCore, JavatroManager, and UI to manage blind options in the game.

## **Sequence Diagram:**

```mermaid

### Logic Component

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant JavatroCore
    participant CommandMap
    participant Options
    participant UI
    participant Manager

    User ->> UI: Issue Command
    UI ->> Manager: Forward Command
    Manager ->> JavatroCore: Process Command
    JavatroCore ->> CommandMap: Check Command Type
    CommandMap ->> Options: Execute Option (e.g., Sort, Discard, Select)
    Options ->> JavatroCore: Return Result
    JavatroCore ->> Manager: Update State
    Manager ->> UI: Render Updated State
```

The Logic Component serves as the Controller in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. It is responsible for managing the application's core logic, processing user commands, and interacting with the Model (e.g., Deck, Ante, PokerHand) through well-defined interfaces. It updates the View through the manager classes.

All classes within the core package make up the Logic Component. This does not include the Deck, Ante, and PokerHand classes, as these are part of the Model. Instead, the Logic Component uses these classes to perform operations and process commands.

- `JavatroCore`: The central controller managing the game flow, initializing components, and processing game state updates.

This component interacts with the UI and Manager components to process user inputs and update the view accordingly.

---

### Storage Component

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant JavatroCore
    participant Storage

    User ->> JavatroCore: Save Game
    JavatroCore ->> Storage: Serialize Game State
    Storage ->> File: Write to Disk

    User ->> JavatroCore: Load Game
    JavatroCore ->> Storage: Read From Disk
    Storage ->> JavatroCore: Deserialize Game State
```

The Storage component is responsible for saving and loading game states. Although not fully implemented, this component would ideally include:
- Persistent storage management using file handling or databases.
- Serialization and deserialization of game objects.
- Handling user preferences and game settings.
---
### Round Component

The **Round Component** is responsible for managing the state and flow of a single round in the game. It encapsulates the logic for handling round-specific actions, configurations, and any special effects.

#### Responsibilities
- Manage the state of the current round, including the cards dealt, scores, and player actions.
- Handle round-specific configurations and validation.
- Notify other components (e.g., UI, Logic) of state changes during the round.

#### Key Classes
- **Round**: The main class that orchestrates the round's lifecycle.
- **RoundState**: Tracks the current state of the round (e.g., active, completed).
- **RoundActions**: Encapsulates actions that can be performed during the round (e.g., draw, discard).
- **RoundConfig**: Stores configuration settings for the round (e.g., max cards, scoring rules).
- **RoundObservable**: Implements the observer pattern to notify listeners (e.g., UI) of state changes.

``` mermaid

### Score Component
The **Score Component** is part of Javatro's scoring system, responsible for calculating the final score based on the played hand, cards, and active jokers. It encapsulates the logic for handling score calculations.


#### Responsibilities
- Handle calculation of scoring played hands, factoring in round-specific configurations and validation.

#### Score Calculation Overview
Below is how the Score Class returns the calculated score:

1. `Round` initializes `Score`, and `Score` invokes the `getChips()` method from `PokerHand`.
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
   activate Round
   Round->>+Score: getScore(PokerHand pokerHand, List<Card> playedCardList, HeldJokers heldJokers)
   Score->>+PokerHand: getChips(), getMultiplier()
   PokerHand-->>-Score: return chips, return multiplier
   deactivate Round

```
2. With each `Card` passed from `Score`, `Score` checks whether the card played satisfies BossType conditions, 
and applies effects if the condition is satisfied. 
Else, the `Card` is scored, and each `Joker` in `heldJokers` is checked if the `Card` can interact with the `Joker`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    box Add contribution from valid cards  
        participant Score
        participant PokerHand
        participant Joker
    end
    activate Score
    loop Card card: playedCardList
        activate Score
        Score->>Score: Apply BossType conditions
        deactivate Score
        alt Card is valid
            activate Score
            Score->>Score: scoreCard(Card card)
            deactivate Score
            loop [Joker joker: heldJokers]
                alt Joker == ONCARDPLAY
                    Score->>+Joker: interact(Score score, Card card)
                    Joker-->>-Score: interact
                end
            end
        end
        deactivate Score
    end
```

3. After each `Card` is scored, any `Joker` with the `AFTERHANDPLAY` enum is interacted with.
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    activate Score
    loop [Joker joker: heldJokers]
        alt joker.ScoreType == AFTERHANDPLAY
            Score->>+Joker: interact(Score score, Card card)
            Joker-->>-Score: interact
        end
    end
    deactivate Score
```


4. `Score` rounds the final score using `calculateFinalScore()` and returns the final `long` value to `Round`.
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    activate Round
    activate Score
    activate Score
    Score->>Score: calculateFinalScore()
    deactivate Score
    Score-->>Round: return final score
    deactivate Score
    deactivate Round

```

    end

## Implementation

### Logic Flow

The application's logic flow is divided into several parts:

1. **Initialization**: The application initializes core components and prepares the user interface.
2. **Gameplay**: Users interact with the UI to perform actions, triggering methods in the core logic.
3. **Round Progression**: Ante handling and deck operations are updated between rounds.
4. **Evaluation**: Poker hands are evaluated using the `PokerHand` class.

### Overview

The Javatro application consists of several packages:

- ``: The main entry point and application setup.
- ``: Core logic, including card handling, ante management, and game rules.
- ``: User interface handling, including screens and rendering.
- ``: Management of different game states and transitions.

### Key Components

- `Javatro`: Initializes and starts the application.
- `JavatroCore`: Handles core game logic such as dealing cards, evaluating hands, and managing ante.
- `Deck`: Manages the deck of cards, shuffling, drawing, etc.
- `Ante`: Handles the ante mechanism, score calculation, and progression through rounds.
- `PokerHand`: Handles poker-specific card evaluation.

### Important Methods

1. 

   - `main()`: Initializes the application.

2. 

   - `initialize()`: Sets up core components.
   - `playRound()`: Manages the game round progression.

3. 

   - `draw()`: Draws a card from the deck.
   - `shuffle()`: Shuffles the deck.

4. 

   - `getRoundScore()`: Retrieves the score for the current round.
   - `nextRound()`: Progresses to the next round.

5. 

   - `evaluateHand()`: Evaluates a set of cards according to poker rules.
