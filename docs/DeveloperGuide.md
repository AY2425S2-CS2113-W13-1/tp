        -currentScreen: Screen  
        -previousScreen: Screen  
        +setCurrentScreen(Screen)  
        +printBorderedContent(...)  
        +centerText(...)  
    }

        +displayOptions()  
    }  

    class GameScreen {  
        -blindScore: int  
        -roundScore: long  
        +propertyChange(...)  
    }  

    UI --> Screen : manages  
    Screen <|-- GameScreen : extends  
    GameScreen ..|> PropertyChangeListener : implements  
```  
*Simplified to highlight core relationships. The `UI` manages `Screen` instances, and `GameScreen` extends `Screen` while observing game state changes.*  

### 1. Overview  
The **UI module** manages screen transitions, user input, and formatted content rendering (e.g., bordered menus, card art). Designed using the **Singleton pattern**, it ensures a single point of control for display operations. This guide details the architecture, key components, and enhancements like dynamic screen rendering and transition logic.  

---

### 2. Architectural Design  

#### 2.1. High-Level Architecture  
The UI follows a **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**-inspired design:  
- **Model**: `JavatroCore` (game state).  
- **View**: `Screen` subclasses (e.g., `GameScreen`, `StartScreen`).  
- **Controller**: `UI` class (manages transitions, input parsing).  

##### Key Design Patterns:  
1. **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a single `UI` instance for centralized screen management.  
2. **Observer Pattern**: `GameScreen` listens to `JavatroCore` for state changes (e.g., score updates).  
3. **State Pattern**: Screens encapsulate state-specific behavior (e.g., `HelpScreen` vs. `GameScreen`).  

#### 2.2. Rationale for Key Decisions  
- **ANSI/Unicode Formatting**: Enables rich terminal UIs without external libraries.  
- **Abstract `Screen` Class**: Promotes code reuse (e.g., `displayOptions()` for command menus).  
- **Centralized `UI` Class**: Simplifies debugging and ensures consistent transitions.  

---

### 3. Component-Level Design  

#### 3.1. The `UI` Class  
**Responsibilities**:  
- **Screen Management**: Stores static references to all screens and handles transitions via `setCurrentScreen()`.  
- **Formatted Output**: Methods like `printBorderedContent()` and `centerText()` standardize layouts.  
- **Utility Functions**: `clearScreen()`, `getCardArtLines()` (renders ASCII card art).  

**Key Code Snippet**:  
```java  
public void setCurrentScreen(Screen screen) {  
    previousScreen = currentScreen;  
    currentScreen = screen;  
    currentScreen.displayScreen(); // Triggers screen-specific rendering  
    PARSER.getOptionInput(); // Handle user input  
}  
```  

#### 3.2. The `Screen` Class Hierarchy  
- **Abstract `Screen` Class**:  
  - Defines `displayScreen()` (abstract) and `displayOptions()` (common command menu).  
  - Manages `commandMap` (list of user-selectable options).  

- **Concrete Screens**:  
  - **`GameScreen`**: Displays real-time game stats, card art, and listens for state changes.  
  - **`HelpScreen`**: Shows static help content.  

**Example: `GameScreen` Property Listener**  
```java  
public void propertyChange(PropertyChangeEvent evt) {  
    switch (evt.getPropertyName()) {  
        case "currentScore":  
            roundScore = (Long) evt.getNewValue();  
            break;  
        // ... other cases  
    }  
    displayScreen(); // Re-render UI on state change  
}  
```  

---

### 5. Key Enhancements  

#### 5.1. Enhancement: Screen Transition Mechanism  
**Implementation**:  
- **Transition Messages**: ANSI-formatted logs (e.g., `Transitioning to: GameScreen`).  
- **Back Navigation**: `previousScreen` allows reverting to prior states (e.g., exiting `HelpScreen`).  

**Sequence Diagram**:  
```mermaid  
sequenceDiagram  
    actor User  
    participant UI  
    participant StartScreen  
    participant GameScreen  

    User->>UI: Enters "play" command  
    UI->>UI: setCurrentScreen(GameScreen)  
    UI->>StartScreen: Save as previousScreen  
    UI->>GameScreen: displayScreen()  
    GameScreen-->>UI: Rendered content  
```  

**Alternatives Considered**:  
- **Stack-Based History**: Rejected due to limited navigation depth requirements.  
- **Immediate Input Handling**: Chose deferred parsing via `Parser` to decouple input from rendering.  

#### 5.2. Enhancement: Dynamic Card Rendering  
- **Card Art Generation**: `CardRenderer` converts `Card` objects to ASCII art with ANSI colour formatting.  
- **Grid Layout**: Renders 8 cards in two rows, spaced with ANSI backgrounds.  

**Code Snippet**:  
```java  
public static List<String> getCardArtLines(List<Card> hand) {  
    List<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();  
    String[][] renderedCards = hand.stream().map(CardRenderer::renderCard).toArray(String[][]::new);  
    // Combine lines horizontally  
    return lines;  
}  
```

#### **5.3. Challenge: Emoji and Unicode Compatibility**  

##### **Initial Attempt**  
Emojis and Unicode symbols (e.g., üÉè, ‚ô•Ô∏è, ‚ô•) were initially incorporated into the UI to enhance visual appeal. For example:  
```java  
// Early prototype (discarded)  
private static String getSuitSymbol(Card.Suit suit) {  
    return switch (suit) {  
        case HEARTS -> "‚ô•Ô∏è";  
        case DIAMONDS -> "‚ô¶Ô∏è";  
        case CLUBS -> "‚ô£Ô∏è";  
        case SPADES -> "‚ô†Ô∏è";  
    };  
}  
```  

##### **Challenges**  
1. **Inconsistent Spacing**:  
   - Emojis/Unicode symbols vary in display width (e.g., `‚ô•Ô∏è` vs. `‚ô†Ô∏è`), causing misalignment in card art.  
   - Example: A heart symbol might be very slightly larger than a regular spacing, breaking grid layouts.  

2. **Terminal Compatibility**:  
   - Terminals like **Windows CMD / Windows Powershell** require `chcp 65001` to display Unicode, which is error-prone for users.  
   - Colored emojis are unsupported in many terminals, leading to monochrome or placeholder symbols (e.g., ` `).  

3. **ANSI Overlap**:  
   - Combining ANSI color codes with Unicode symbols introduced unpredictable formatting (e.g., background colors bleeding into adjacent text).  

##### **Final Approach**  
To ensure cross-terminal compatibility and consistent spacing, **letters** (`H`, `D`, `C`, `S`) replaced symbols:  
```java  
// Current implementation (CardRenderer.java)  
private static String getSuitSymbol(Card.Suit suit) {  
    return switch (suit) {  
        case HEARTS -> "H";  
        case DIAMONDS -> "D";  
        case CLUBS -> "C";  
        case SPADES -> "S";  
    };  
}  
```  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Fixed-width characters ensure alignment in card art.  
  - Works universally across terminals without configuration.  
  - ANSI colors apply cleanly to letters (e.g., `H` in red for hearts).

#### **UML Diagrams**  

##### **CardRenderer Class Diagram**  
```mermaid  
classDiagram  
    class CardRenderer {  
        +renderCard(Card): String[]  
        -getSuitSymbol(Suit): String  
        -getColour(Suit): String  
    }  
```  
*The `CardRenderer` class maps suits to letters (`H`, `D`, `C`, `S`) and colors using ANSI codes.*  

##### **Card Rendering Sequence Diagram**  
```mermaid  
sequenceDiagram  
    participant GameScreen  
    participant CardRenderer  
    participant Card  

    GameScreen->>CardRenderer: renderCard(card)  
    CardRenderer->>Card: getSuit()  
    CardRenderer->>CardRenderer: getSuitSymbol() ‚Üí "H"  
    CardRenderer->>CardRenderer: getColour() ‚Üí ANSI code  
    CardRenderer-->>GameScreen: [" H ", ...]  
    GameScreen->>UI: Display formatted card art  
```

#### **Key Takeaways**  
- **Prioritize Functionality Over Aesthetics**: Letters ensured reliability, while emojis introduced terminal-specific bugs.  
- **Test Across Environments**: The decision to avoid Unicode was driven by rigorous testing in CMD, PowerShell, and Unix terminals.  
- **Code Hygiene**: Unused symbols (e.g., `‚ô†` in `UI`) should be removed in future refactoring.  

This approach balances visual clarity with technical robustness, ensuring the UI works seamlessly for all users.

### 6. Future Considerations  

1. **GUI Framework Integration**: Migrate to JavaFX for animations and mouse support.  
2. **Theming System**: Allow users to customize colors via config files.  
3. **Accessibility Mode**: Add high-contrast themes and screen-reader support.  

---

### 7. Conclusion  
The UI module‚Äôs design prioritizes modularity, extensibility, and terminal compatibility. By combining design patterns like Singleton and Observer with ANSI formatting, it delivers a responsive and visually consistent experience. Future developers can extend it by adding new `Screen` subclasses or integrating modern GUI frameworks.

### Logic Component

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant JavatroCore
    participant CommandMap
    participant Options
    participant UI
    participant Manager

    User ->> UI: Issue Command
    UI ->> Manager: Forward Command
    Manager ->> JavatroCore: Process Command
    JavatroCore ->> CommandMap: Check Command Type
    CommandMap ->> Options: Execute Option (e.g., Sort, Discard, Select)
    Options ->> JavatroCore: Return Result
    JavatroCore ->> Manager: Update State
    Manager ->> UI: Render Updated State
```

The Logic Component serves as the Controller in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. It is responsible for managing the application's core logic, processing user commands, and interacting with the Model (e.g., Deck, Ante, PokerHand) through well-defined interfaces. It updates the View through the manager classes.

All classes within the core package make up the Logic Component. This does not include the Deck, Ante, and PokerHand classes, as these are part of the Model. Instead, the Logic Component uses these classes to perform operations and process commands.

- `JavatroCore`: The central controller managing the game flow, initializing components, and processing game state updates.

This component interacts with the UI and Manager components to process user inputs and update the view accordingly.

---

### Storage Component

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant JavatroCore
    participant Storage

    User ->> JavatroCore: Save Game
    JavatroCore ->> Storage: Serialize Game State
    Storage ->> File: Write to Disk

    User ->> JavatroCore: Load Game
    JavatroCore ->> Storage: Read From Disk
    Storage ->> JavatroCore: Deserialize Game State
```

The Storage component is responsible for saving and loading game states. Although not fully implemented, this component would ideally include:
- Persistent storage management using file handling or databases.
- Serialization and deserialization of game objects.
- Handling user preferences and game settings.
---
### Round Component

The **Round Component** is responsible for managing the state and flow of a single round in the game. It encapsulates the logic for handling round-specific actions, configurations, and any special effects.

#### Responsibilities
- Manage the state of the current round, including the cards dealt, scores, and player actions.
- Handle round-specific configurations and validation.
- Notify other components (e.g., UI, Logic) of state changes during the round.

#### Key Classes
- **Round**: The main class that orchestrates the round's lifecycle.
- **RoundState**: Tracks the current state of the round (e.g., active, completed).
- **RoundActions**: Encapsulates actions that can be performed during the round (e.g., draw, discard).
- **RoundConfig**: Stores configuration settings for the round (e.g., max cards, scoring rules).
- **RoundObservable**: Implements the observer pattern to notify listeners (e.g., UI) of state changes.

``` mermaid
classDiagram
    class Round {
        -state: RoundState
        -config: RoundConfig
        -observable: RoundObservable
        +addPropertyChangeListener(pcl: PropertyChangeListener)

        -applyBossVariants()
    }

    class RoundState {
        -currentScore: long
        -remainingDiscards: int
        -remainingPlays: int
        -playerJokers: HeldJokers
        -deck: Deck
        -playerHand: HoldingHand
        -chosenCards: Card
        +getPlayerJokers(): HeldJokers
        +getDeck(): Deck
        +drawInitialCards(count: int)
    }

    class RoundConfig {
        +INITIAL_HAND_SIZE: int
        +MAX_DISCARDS_PER_ROUND: int
        +DEFAULT_MAX_HAND_SIZE: int
        +DEFAULT_MIN_HAND_SIZE: int
        -blindScore: int
        -roundName: String
        -roundDescription: String
    }

    class RoundActions {
        +playCards(state: RoundState, config: RoundConfig, cardIndices: Integer): ActionResult
        +discardCards(state: RoundState, config: RoundConfig, cardIndices: Integer): ActionResult
        -validatePlayCards(cardIndices: Integer, minHandSize: int, maxHandSize: int, remainingPlays: int)
        -validateDiscardCards(cardIndices: Integer, remainingDiscards: int)
    }

    class RoundObservable {
        +addObserver(observer: Observer)
        +removeObserver(observer: Observer)
        +notifyObservers(event: String)
    }

    Round --> RoundState: contains
    Round --> RoundConfig: contains
    Round --> RoundObservable: contains
    Round ..> RoundActions: uses
```

#### Sequence Diagram: Round Initialisation

```

Note: Due to limitations of mermaid rendering, the activation bars for constructors may not appear exactly aligned with their corresponding object lifelines. The note in the diagram clarifies when the constructor is activated.

## Implementation

### Logic Flow

The application's logic flow is divided into several parts:

1. **Initialization**: The application initializes core components and prepares the user interface.
2. **Gameplay**: Users interact with the UI to perform actions, triggering methods in the core logic.
3. **Round Progression**: Ante handling and deck operations are updated between rounds.
4. **Evaluation**: Poker hands are evaluated using the `PokerHand` class.

### Overview

The Javatro application consists of several packages:

- ``: The main entry point and application setup.
- ``: Core logic, including card handling, ante management, and game rules.
- ``: User interface handling, including screens and rendering.
- ``: Management of different game states and transitions.

### Key Components

- `Javatro`: Initializes and starts the application.
- `JavatroCore`: Handles core game logic such as dealing cards, evaluating hands, and managing ante.
- `Deck`: Manages the deck of cards, shuffling, drawing, etc.
- `Ante`: Handles the ante mechanism, score calculation, and progression through rounds.
- `PokerHand`: Handles poker-specific card evaluation.

### Important Methods

1. 

   - `main()`: Initializes the application.

2. 

   - `initialize()`: Sets up core components.
   - `playRound()`: Manages the game round progression.

3. 

   - `draw()`: Draws a card from the deck.
   - `shuffle()`: Shuffles the deck.

4. 

   - `getRoundScore()`: Retrieves the score for the current round.
   - `nextRound()`: Progresses to the next round.

5. 

   - `evaluateHand()`: Evaluates a set of cards according to poker rules.
