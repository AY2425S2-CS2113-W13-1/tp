**Javatro** is a command-line card game inspired by **Balatro**.  
It blends strategic decision-making with poker mechanics and roguelike elements to deliver an engaging, fast-paced experience right in your terminal.

## Overview

- **Gameplay:**  
  Master multiple deck types, each with unique bonuses, and build high-scoring poker hands to defeat dynamically challenging blinds.  
- **Mechanics:**  
  Strategically choose when to play or discard cards, manage limited resources (hands and discards), and upgrade your hands via Planet Cards and Joker effects.  
- **Objective:**  
  Progress through rounds—each featuring Small, Large, and Boss Blinds—to eventually win at Ante 8 and earn your victory.
  
## Quick Start

**Requirements:**  
- Java 17  
- A terminal with fullscreen (or sufficiently wide) dimensions for the best experience.

**Installation:**  
1. Download the `javatro.jar` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-W13-1/tp/releases/tag/release-v2.1).  
2. Open your terminal (ideally in fullscreen mode).  
3. Run one of these commands:
   ```bash
   java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -jar javatro.jar
