### Choosing a Blind
![Blind Selection](ug_images/blind_menu.png)

After selecting a deck, players are prompted to select a **Blind**.
Blinds are the main obstacle that the player must overcome in Javatro. 
For each round, the player has to get enough score to beat the Blind, losing the game otherwise. 
_Defeating the Blind will award the player with rewards._

An **Ante** is made up of three Blinds in succession: a Small Blind, a Large Blind, and a random Boss Blind. 
The player can choose to take on a Small or Big Blind, or to skip one or both. 
_Boss Blinds must always be played and cannot be skipped._

The score required by a certain Blind is determined by the Ante level. 
Players start at Ante 1 and go up a level for every Boss Blind defeated, 
and can win the game by beating the last level of a run, at Ante 8.

#### Information Provided:
| Blind Type  | Target Score                     |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Small Blind | A **low** score requirement      |
| Large Blind | A **moderate** score requirement |
| Boss Blind  | A **high** score requirement     |

#### Menu Options:
- `1. Accept Blind`
- `2. Reject Blind`

_Enter `1` to accept the current blind and proceed to the game, 
or `2` to reject the current blind and select a different one._

### Game Interface
![Game Screen](ug_images/small_blind.png)

After selecting `1. Accept Blind`, players will be shown the main **Javatro game interface** and dealt cards at the start of each round.

To **defeat a blind**, the player must select cards from their hand to play poker hands and score chips. 
_A given number of discards are available to assist with creating better hands._ 

If the player is unable to reach the blind's chip requirement in the allotted number of hands, 
the run is **lost**, and the player must _restart_ from Ante 1.

Upon reaching the score requirement, the round ends and the player receives rewards.
When Ante 8 is completed, the player **wins** the run, and is allowed to start a new one.

### Winning a Boss Blind

![Win Joker Screen](ug_images/win_joker.png)

**Boss Blinds** are the last blind of an **Ante**, most of which require a score of _2x base chips_.  
**Boss Blinds** have certain special effects that add difficulty to the round and are randomly selected.
_Boss Blinds cannot be skipped._

After successfully beating a **Boss Blind**, players receive a _random_ **Joker Card**.

**Jokers** are special cards at the core of Javatro's gameplay. They possess _unique effects_ that can synergize, 
and a strong combination of jokers is typically essential for the player to defeat Blinds at higher Antes.

Instead of being included in Decks and played alongside standard cards, 
Jokers are held in the player's _5 dedicated joker slots_, and their effects will automatically be activated during gameplay.

#### Menu Options:
- `1. Start Next Round`
- `2. Exit Game`

_Enter `1` to proceed to the next round,
or `2` to end the current game session._

## Known Issues

### Terminal Window Behavior

**Description:**  
**Javatro**’s UI relies on consistent terminal dimensions to render ANSI graphics and other elements correctly. Two specific scenarios can cause display issues:

1. **Resizing the Terminal Window During Execution:**  
   _Changing_ the terminal window size while the program is running can disrupt the UI layout and cause misalignment or incorrect rendering of output.

2. **Using a Small Terminal Window:**  
   If the terminal window is _not wide enough_, lines may wrap around, distorting the intended structure of ASCII elements and making the output hard to read.

**Recommended Solution:**  
To ensure proper UI rendering, players are advised to:
- Use a **fullscreen terminal window** before starting the program.
- **Avoid resizing** the terminal during program execution.
- Ensure the terminal is **wide enough** to accommodate full-line prints without wrapping.

Following these guidelines will help maintain the intended appearance and functionality of the **Javatro**’s UI.

## Glossary

**Ante**  
A stage of a run. Each run is divided into multiple antes (usually eight), 
with each ante consisting of several rounds (blinds) that you must clear to progress.

**Blind**  
A round within an ante where you must score enough points (chips) to beat the challenge. There are three types:
- **Small Blind**: The first round; you can optionally skip it.
- **Big Blind**: The second round; similar to the Small Blind.
- **Boss Blind**: The final round of an ante with a unique, often restrictive challenge. This round cannot be skipped.

**Chips**  
Points earned from playing a hand. 
Each hand’s chip value is calculated from the cards played and later multiplied by a multiplier.

**Multiplier**  
A factor that increases your hand’s chip score. 
Multipliers can be raised through various effects, most notably by equipping Joker cards and obtaining Planet Cards.

**Joker**  
Special cards that reside in your “Joker slots” (up to five by default) and grant passive effects. 
These effects may add chips, boost multipliers, or modify how hands are scored. 

**Playing Cards**  
The standard cards (initially a 52-card deck) that form the basis of every hand.

**Planet Cards**  
Upgrades specific poker hand types by increasing their base chip value and multiplier.

**Discard**  
A limited resource per round that lets you exchange unwanted cards from your hand. 
Managing discards is crucial for optimizing your hand.

**Hand Size**  
The number of cards drawn at the start of each round. It determines your options for forming poker hands.

**Hands**  
The number of times you can play cards during a round (similar to “lives”). 
If you run out of hands before meeting the blind’s score, the run ends.

**Run**  
A complete play session. A run ends when you fail an ante or successfully clear the final Boss Blind.
