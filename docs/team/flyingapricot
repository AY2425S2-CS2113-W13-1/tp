# Project: Javatro

**Javatro** is a CLI-based poker game application built using Java inspired by Balatro. It features a detailed MVC architecture to ensure separation of concerns, a robust storage system with hashing for security, and various quality-of-life improvements to streamline development and enhance the user experience. It is written in Java, with a codebase exceeding 4 kLoC.

## Given below are my contributions to the project.

### New Feature: Storage System with Security and Facade Design Pattern
- **What it does:** Allows users to save their game runs, ensuring data security through hashing mechanisms and structuring the storage operations using a facade pattern for better maintainability.
- **Justification:** This feature was essential to provide persistence for game progress, allowing users to save, load, and manage their runs effectively. The use of hashing ensures that the stored data is protected against tampering.
- **Highlights:** This feature required designing an interface that could seamlessly integrate with the existing architecture. The hashing mechanism was carefully implemented to enhance security while maintaining usability.
- **Credits:** Reused concepts from various storage and hashing libraries.

### New Feature: Auto Formatter Integration with Google Java Format
- **What it does:** Adds an automatic code formatter to the project using Google's Java Format tool.
- **Justification:** This feature significantly reduces the time spent on manual formatting and linting, enhancing productivity and ensuring consistent code quality across the team.
- **Highlights:** The integration of this tool into the DevOps pipeline required configuring the CI to ensure all code commits adhere to a unified style.

---

### New Feature: MVC Architecture Implementation
- **What it does:** Establishes a proper MVC architecture for the game, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and enhancing code maintainability and scalability.
- **Justification:** The use of MVC architecture was crucial for providing a solid structural foundation for the application. It improves the organization of the codebase and facilitates future feature additions.
- **Highlights:** This implementation required refactoring the existing codebase, designing controllers, models, and views, and ensuring smooth interaction between them.
- **Credits:** Inspired by standard MVC design patterns used in software engineering.

---

### New Feature: Load Run Screen UI
- **What it does:** Implements the user interface for the Load Run screen, enhancing the user experience by providing a clear and engaging way to manage saved runs.
- **Justification:** A well-designed UI is essential for users to interact with saved data efficiently. This screen provides visual feedback and navigation options for managing runs.
- **Highlights:** This feature was designed to align with the MVC architecture, requiring coordination between the UI, core logic, and storage components.

---

### New Feature: Establishing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- **What it does:** Sets up the foundational architecture, functionalities, and screens necessary to provide a working baseline for the application.
- **Justification:** Creating the MVP was critical to ensuring that the project had a stable base upon which further enhancements and features could be built.
- **Highlights:** This task involved heavy integration of various components, including UI, storage, MVC architecture, and command processing.
