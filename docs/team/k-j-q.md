2. **`RoundState` Class (203 lines)**
   - Developed a dedicated state management class to encapsulate the mutable aspects of a game round
   - Implemented methods for tracking scores, remaining plays/discards, and player resources
   - Created a clean interface for state modifications with validation

3. **`RoundActions` Class (160 lines)**
   - Designed a utility class to handle card play and discard logic with robust validation
   - Implemented the ActionResult pattern to return multiple pieces of information about game actions
   - Created validation methods that enforce game rules for card plays and discards

4. **`RoundConfig` Class (145 lines)**
   - Developed a configuration class to store game round parameters and settings
   - Implemented boss-type specific configurations that modify gameplay rules
   - Created constants and configuration methods with appropriate access modifiers

5. **`RoundObservable` Class (44 lines)**
   - Implemented the Observer pattern to notify UI components of state changes
   - Created methods for registering listeners and broadcasting state updates

#### Comprehensive Testing
- **`RoundTest` Class (372 lines)**
   - Created extensive unit tests covering all aspects of the Round component
   - Implemented tests for normal gameplay, edge cases, and error conditions
   - Developed helper methods to reduce code duplication in tests
   - Achieved high test coverage for the Round component

### Enhancements Implemented

#### Game Round Management
- **Round Structure and Flow**:
  - Developed the complete round lifecycle management system including initialization, play, discard, and completion
  - Implemented the `Round` class to manage the state and flow of a single game round, including configurations, scoring, and boss-specific rules
  - Created the `RoundState` and `RoundConfig` classes to properly separate concerns following SOLID principles

#### Boss Mechanics
- **Boss-Specific Gameplay Rules**:
  - Implemented unique gameplay modifications for different boss types:
    - `THE_NEEDLE`: Limited plays to 1 per round
    - `THE_WATER`: Removed ability to discard cards
    - `THE_PSYCHIC`: Required exactly 5 cards in every hand
  - Added boss-specific scoring restrictions in the `Score` class

#### Card Actions System
- **Card Play and Discard Logic**:
  - Enhanced the `RoundActions` class with a stateless design for better testability
  - Implemented comprehensive validation for all card actions
  - Created a flexible `ActionResult` pattern to return multiple values from actions

#### Observer Pattern Implementation
- **UI Update Mechanism**:
  - Implemented the `RoundObservable` class using the Observer pattern
  - Created a clean interface for UI components to register as listeners
  - Enabled automatic UI updates when round state changes

### Documentation Contributions

#### Developer Guide (DG)
- **Round Component Documentation**:
  - Created comprehensive class diagrams showing the relationships between Round classes
  - Developed detailed sequence diagrams for key methods:
    - `playCards`: Showing the flow from user input to score calculation
    - `discardCards`: Illustrating the card replacement mechanism
    - `isWon` and `isRoundOver`: Documenting win condition evaluation
  - Added technical documentation explaining the Observer pattern implementation
  - Wrote detailed explanations of the Round component's responsibilities and design decisions

#### User Guide (UG)
- **Player Instructions**:
  - Added clear descriptions of possible user inputs for playing and discarding cards
  - Documented round mechanics and scoring rules for player reference
  - Created examples showing valid card selections and their outcomes

### Team-Based Contributions

#### Code Integration and Architecture
- **Component Integration**:
  - Designed the Round component to integrate cleanly with other system components
  - Implemented proper interfaces for the Deck, Player, and Score components
  - Collaborated with team members to ensure consistent coding style and architecture

#### Code Review and Refinement
- **Pull Request Reviews**:
  - Reviewed pull requests related to gameplay mechanics
  - Provided detailed feedback on code quality and suggested improvements
  - Identified potential bugs and edge cases in gameplay implementations

#### Testing Coordination
- **Test Framework Development**:
  - Established patterns for comprehensive unit testing
  - Created helper methods used across multiple test classes
  - Implemented robust test cases covering normal operation and edge cases
